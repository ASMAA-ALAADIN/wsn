# WSN simulator
A Wireless Sensor Network simulator in Python and C++ (via SWIG).

It basically simulates the communication among nodes and communication with the base station. It has a energy model that helps estimates the network lifetime. It has some pre-defined scenarios (including clustering techniques):
- Direct Communication (from nodes directly to the base station);
- [MTE][1]
- [LEACH][2]
- [FCM][3]

It also implements a modified version of PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) in order to schedule sleeping slots to every node at every communication round. This implementation is based on [this paper][4], but contains improvements, specially concerning the learning of better solutions. [NSGA-II][5] is also implemented.

# Running it
1 - Choose your settings in the configuration file (config.py)

2 - Compile C++/Python wrappers: python setup.py build_ext --inplace

3 - python run.py

# Requirements
All non-trivial requirements (the ones you cannot get via pip install) are inside this repository.
