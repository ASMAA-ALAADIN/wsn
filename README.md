# WSN simulator
A simulator of Wireless Sensor Networks in Python and C++ (via SWIG).

It basically simulates the communication among nodes and communication with the base station. It has a energy model that helps estimates the network lifetime. It has some pre-defined scenarios (including clustering techniques):
- Direct Communication (from nodes directly to the base station);
- MTE (M. Ettus. System Capacity, Latency, and Power Consumption in Multihop-routed SS-CDMA Wireless Networks. In Radio and Wireless Conference (RAWCON 98), pages 55â€“58, Aug. 1998)
- LEACH (W. Heinzelman, A. Chandrakasan, and H. Balakrishnan, Energy-efficient communication protocols for wireless sensor networks, In Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), Hawaii, USA, January 2000.)
- FCM (D. C. Hoang, R. Kumar and S. K. Panda, "Fuzzy C-Means clustering protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks," 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics, Bari, 2010, pp. 3477-3482.)

It also implements a modified version of PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) in order to schedule sleeping slots to every node. This implementation is based on (C. Yu, W. Guo and G. Chen, "Energy-balanced Sleep Scheduling Based on Particle Swarm Optimization in Wireless Sensor Network," 2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum, Shanghai, 2012, pp. 1249-1255.), but contains some improvements, specially to the learning of better solutions.

# Running it
Choose your settings in the configuration file (config.py), then:

swig -python -shadow -c++ pso.i

python setup.py build_ext --inplace

python run.py

# Requirements
All non-trivial requirements (the ones you cannot get via pip install) are inside this repository.
